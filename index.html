                    <div class="sdesc">The main aim of my studies has been to to build a robust foundation of knowledge of ML models, from the maths behind them to their implementation and training in PyTorch. This has been an ever-evolving process, starting starting from statistic and probabilistic foundations in my MSc towards self-studied courses/papers on Deep Learning specifics.</div>

Most noteably, an end-to-end cooking recipe generation project using data of foods' molecular compositions, as well as my main project as a Software Engineer at Sky: the development of an assistant Slack chatbot application which served as a core automation fascilitation for the DevOps support department. </div>

The bulk work of my Recipe Generator project was building the dataset behind it, which involved creating a fuzzy matching library to link 3 datasets together, and the distributed data processing & feature engineering that came along with this. On top of that I have had a taste of building ETL pipelines through a practice project pulling data from BigQuery using Apache Beam.</div>
